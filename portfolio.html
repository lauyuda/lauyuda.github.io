								<h2>Portfolio Asset Allocation</h2>
								<h3>Looking at past 5 years and 10 years of backtesting results:</h3>

								<h3>Examining the correlation table:</h3>
								<span><img src="images/correlation.png" class="center" alt="" /></span>
								<dl>
									<dt>Equities versus Bonds</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>The generated portfolio allocation by Monte Carlo overweights the three bonds (AGG, HYG, and EMB)
											because of the low/negative correlation with the other equities. This is what would be described
											as avoiding putting all the eggs into one basket. On the other hand, the actual portfolio allocation took
											more risk to get a higher return.
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>USA, Europe, and Emerging Markets(EM)</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>These three equities are highly correlated with one another and has high correlation to other
											equities as well. It is likely that USA has a superior return-to-risk ratio to the other two 
											which explains for Europe and EM to be underweighted in all Monte Carlo simulated portfolio. 
											In the actual portfolio, EM had a much higher weight.
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>China</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>China likely has high variance but relatively higher returns which explains that China had less
											than 1% allocation in the minimum variance portfolio but 10.9% and 23.3% in the 5 years max Sharpe
											and 10 years max Sharpe portfolio respectively.
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Japan and Frontier Markets(FM)</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Both Japan and FM have correlations which can be described to fall in the mid-range. In terms of 
											diversification, it makes them relevant in reducing variance and hold about 10% each in the simulated 
											minimum variance portfolio. However, lack of confidence in the FM and the underperforming Japanese
											market meant that they have very low weights in the actual portfolio. 
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Singapore</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Singapore likely has low returns and high standard deviation which causes it to be 
											unfavourable in both minimum variance and maximum Sharpe ratio portfolios. It was kept
											at the minimum of 5% in the actual portfolio due to a constraint by the virtual client.
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Minimum Variance Portfolio</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>It is interesting to note that the 5 years and 10 years minimum variance portfolio remained the
											same whereas there was quite a change for a max Sharpe ratio based portfolio. This suggests that
											it may be more "stable and consistent" to use the minimum variance portfolio.

								<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
								<h3>Bollinger Band for CMC200:</h3>
								<span><img src="images/bollinger.png" class="center" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The price of CMC200 double in less than one month and I looked into should the portfolio 
									include crypto out of FOMO. Bollinger bands consist of a centerline and two price channels 
									(bands) above and below it. The centerline is a moving average; the price channels are the 
									standard deviations (usually 2 std dev) of the ticker. The bands will widen as the stock
									becomes more volatile.
								</p>
								<p>When CMC200 prices continually touch the upper Bollinger band, the prices are thought to be 
									overbought; conversely, when they continually touch the lower band, prices are thought to be 
									oversold, triggering a buy signal. As evident, it is not a good idea to buy CMC200 due to rising 
									prices and FOMO.
								</p>
								<p>After this analysis, the price continued climbing despite showing signs of overbuying. One can 
									never win bets 100% of the time.
